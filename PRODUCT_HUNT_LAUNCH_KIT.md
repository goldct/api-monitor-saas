## 📝 Launch Post (First Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to launch API Monitor SaaS today!

After struggling with expensive, complex API monitoring tools, I built something simple that actually works for developers.

**What makes it different:**
- Setup in 2 minutes, not 2 hours
- Pricing that doesn't break the bank
- All the features you need, nothing you don't

**Why I built it:**
I was paying $50+/month for API monitoring when I only needed to track 3 endpoints. I couldn't find an affordable alternative, so I built one.

**What's next:**
- SMS alerts (coming next month)
- Webhook integrations
- Team collaboration features

**Special offer for Product Hunters:**
Use code `PH30` for 30% off your first 3 months!
